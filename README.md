lowercase
=========


Inspired by the program used in this [this video giving a light overview of the Unix operating system](http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/2/22/AT&T-Archives-The-UNIX-System) 

And inspired on the [djhworld/makewords](https://github.com/djhworld/makewords) project.

Maybe we can have others developers who can make the next programs (sort and unique)

Installation and Usage
=========

$ dmd lowercase.d 
$ cat myfile.txt | ./lowercase

Using with the makewords program

$ cat myfile.txt | ./makewords | ./lowercase
